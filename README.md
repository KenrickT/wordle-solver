# wordle-solver
A simple python script that creates a shortlist of the best Wordle Guesses - given a user's guess and Wordle's "color feedback".

### Notes
- this is my first personal project, feedback is appreciated!
- `readme.md` is WIP

### Instructions
- install required libraries from `requirements.txt`
- simply run `solver.py` and follow the instructions
- input `summary` to show your final colored-boxes
- input `restart` to refresh and start from a first guess
